This project involves creating a C++ program for Chada Tech, a software engineering company, to display two clocks simultaneously (12-hour and 24-hour) and allow user input to adjust the time. 

I particularly focused on creating a modular structure using an object-oriented approach, ensuring readability and maintainability. 

To enhance the code, I could add error handling for invalid user inputs and implement input validation to ensure secure user interactions. Additionally, I could optimize the display functions for efficiency by reducing redundancy in the code.

The most challenging part was structuring the code to handle user input and displaying the clock options. I overcame this by breaking down the problem into smaller tasks and organizing the code logically.

The skills gained from this project, such as modularization, object-oriented programming, and user interaction handling, are transferable to various other projects and coursework involving C++ development.

To make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I used clear and descriptive variable names, organized the code into functions, and added comments to explain the logic and functionality. This makes it easier for others to understand and modify the code in the future.
